# Workshop proposal: Liberate Your Research Code

by [Leonardo Uieda](http://www.leouieda.com)

Funding proposal to the Mozilla Science Lab Mini Grant for a 2-3 day workshop.


## In one sentence, summarize the purpose of the grant

We will host a 2-3 day hands-on workshop to teach participants how to publish
their source code online, choose an open-source license, receive credit for
their code contribution, and collaborate effectively using version control
(git) and websites like Github, figshare, and Zenodo.


## Project Description (2500 char)

Scientist are often required to write code when conducting research or
preparing educational material.

When publishing the paper, the code sits in their harddrive.

It took a lot of time and effort to develop the code.

Many students  and researchers end up rewriting the same code.

Often times repeating the same mistakes.

Many scientists want to publish their code.

Common complaints: code is ugly, it's too much work, they don't know how.

They are often not trained to do this.

Version control and github can be very intimidating if starting out from
nothing.

Licensing is confusing and often thought of as unnecessary.

DOIs and what to include in your submission is also not clear.

This workshop will offer a crash course into the current ways of doing these
things.


By the end of the course, participants will have their research code in a
Github repository (including an open-source license and a README file) and be
ready to publish the code by uploading to figshare or Zenodo.  They will also
have collaborated on each other's repositories by submitting at least one pull
request.

The course will be hands-on. I will provide a short introductions to the tools
that will be covered followed by guided examples. The majority of the time will
be spent working on real research code that the participants produced.
