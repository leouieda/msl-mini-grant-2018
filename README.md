# Workshop proposal: Liberate Your Research Code

by [Leonardo Uieda](http://www.leouieda.com)

Funding proposal to the Mozilla Science Lab Mini Grant for a 2-3 day workshop.


## In one sentence, summarize the purpose of the grant

I will host a 2-3 day hands-on workshop to teach participants how to publish
their source code online, choose an open-source license, receive credit for
their code contribution, and collaborate effectively using version control
and websites like Github, figshare, and Zenodo.


## Project Description

The workshop will teach the basics of publishing research code and
collaborating on a software project.
It will cover some of the best practices in scientific computing,
namely version control with git and Github,
open-source licenses,
software citation,
and archival in DOI issuing websites (figshare and Zenodo).

Each day of the workshop will start with a small presentation followed by a
live demonstration and 1-2 group exercises.
The rest of the time will be dedicated to work on code that the participants
wish to publish from one of their own projects.
Those who are unable to do this will collaborate on a colleague's
project.
To train collaboration, all participants will be required to submit at least
one pull request to another participant's repository.
On the last day, the participants will give 5 minute presentations on what they
have accomplished.

The workshop will be taught at the University of Hawaii at Manoa and will be
targeted at Earth Science graduate students, postdocs, and faculty.
Depending on the popularity of the workshop, I may be able to expand the
offering to other disciplines.
I will use the grant to fund marketing (flyers and stickers), coffee
breaks, food for a socializing event during the presentations on the last day,
and a venue (if possible).

By the end of the workshop, each participant will have published their code on
a Github repository.
It will contain a README, an open-source license, citation information, and a
Makefile that automates building the software and generating sample results.
Ideally, the repository will also be archived on figshare or Zenodo.
I will develop exercises and presentations for the workshop but will
reuse Software Carpentry material when appropriate.
All of the material created for the workshop will be freely available online
under a CC-BY license.
I will also write blog posts detailing the planning and execution of the
workshop as well as the feedback received.

We expect that participants will leave with the minimum knowledge required to
publish the code for their next project.
They will also be equipped with some of the skills necessary to make
contributions to the open-source software on which they rely.
We hope that new collaborations between the participants will emerge through
the emphasis on group exercises and the socializing event.
