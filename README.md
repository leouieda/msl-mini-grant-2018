# Workshop proposal: Liberate Your Research Code

by [Leonardo Uieda](http://www.leouieda.com)

Funding proposal to the Mozilla Science Lab Mini Grant for a 2-3 day workshop
to teach participants how to publish their source code online, get credit for
it, and collaborate effectively.

By the end of the course, participants will have their research code in a
Github repository (including an open-source license and a README file) and be
ready to publish the code by uploading to figshare or Zenodo.
They will also have collaborated on each other's repositories by submitting at
least one pull request.

The course will be hands-on. I will provide a short introductions to the tools
that will be covered followed by guided examples. The majority of the time will
be spent working on real research code that the participants produced.
